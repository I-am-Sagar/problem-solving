### Dynamic Programming
<hr>

If you are learning DP for the first time and you are referring to this repository, I will suggest learn it in this way. This has worked for me *(self-learnt)*, I am sure it will work for you as well! All the best!

| Timeline | To-do | Resources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day 1| Go through the fibonacci codes. Try to then solve following problems from the `Problem_Set_Easy`: <ul><li>Min Steps to One</li></ul> | `01_Fibonacci` is enough. |

Here is the list of all different codes you are going to find in this folder:

1. Fibonacci/Staircase
2. Min Steps to One
3. 0/1 Knapsack
4. Subset Sum Problem
