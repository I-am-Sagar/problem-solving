### C++ Language
<hr>

Here we are going to learn the points which are important in problem solving, and should be learnt while learning C++. In C++, we have a *Standard Template Library*, also called as STL, which gives us a lot of ready-made data structrues/containers that allows us to perform a lot of operations very easily, which would take hell of a time otherwise for us to code from scratch. 

In STL, we have 4 types of containers available:

* **Sequence Containers:** vector, list, deque, arrays
* **Non-sequence Containers:** stack, queue, priority_queue
* **Associative Containers:** set, map, multiset, multimap
* **Unordered Associative Containers:** unordered_set, unordered_map, unordered_multiset, unordered_multimap
