### Problem Solving Preparation 
<hr/>

I am looking for a job, and here I am preparing DSA again. 

#### 1st Test: 14th April

I am expecting 4 questions in this 90 minutes test. Roughly this should be the format:

**Question 1:** Array-based Questions, Searching-Sorting, Adhoc Problems   
**Question 2:** Strings, Number Theory   
**Question 3:** Trees or Graphs   
**Question 4:** Dynamic Programming (covers all Recursion only questions as well)   

Since there is a high chance of Dynamic Programming question for sure, I started with it. 

**DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING**

**Round 1**

1. I wanted to start with templates (All top-down approach i.e. memoization.) 
    * Fibonacci 
    * Knapsack (0-1 and Unbounded)
    * Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
    * Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
    * Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM)
2. Classic DP Problems. Approach these problems without thinking that they are a variant of a template. Think of them as a standalone topic and should be solved independently. These I will prefer with top-down approach as well i.e. memoization.
    * Weighted Job Scheduling 
3. DP Problems on Grids (Grids are easy to be solved using bottom-up approach i.e. tabulation.)
    * Min cost path in a grid with 2-directional motion allowed
    * Max sum submatrix in a 2D matrix
    * *Follow Up*: Largest submatrix with sum divisible by k
    * Largest submatrix with all 1s in a binary 2D matrix

**Round 2**

4. Advanced Theory on DP (Usually optional in the first round. These are typical for competitive programming and I am skeptical companies ask such questions in interviews.)
    * DP with Bitmasking

**Problem Set** (for my practice/test)
